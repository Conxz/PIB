# PIB:Personally Identifiable Brains
The idea of Personally Identifiable Brains (PIB) is for collecting brain imaging data with personal identity.  This project is largely inspired by Poldrackâ€™s MyConnectome Project.  From [Here](http://conxz.net/2017/06/20/personally-identifiable-brain) and [Here](http://conxz.net/2017/07/05/personally-identifiable-brain2/) you can find more information about the idea.

- [Data](https://openfmri.org/dataset/ds000224/) ID: MSC02
- The goal of the MSC project is to enable precise MRI-based characterization of individual humans by collecting large quantities of MRI and fMRI data on each of ten subjects. In each subject, we collected five hours of resting state fMRI, six hours of task fMRI across four different tasks, and four scans in each of four different anatomical modalities.

- T1 and several functional brain scans of a single subject obtained on a 3T scanner. The subject (also the author of this dataset) is was a 28 years old healthy male. Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) was used.
